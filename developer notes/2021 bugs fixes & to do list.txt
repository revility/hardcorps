(UPDATES)
	+Reduce push for plasma gun projectiles.
(BUGS) {
	+If the player touches both jump through platform triggers in just the right way, the platform goes solid and stops their momentum while jumping.
	+Enemy fireballs do not explode when hitting water and roll around
	+Back pedaling with keyboard aiming can get wonky.
	+Enemies run in circles if above or below the player.  This is due to the hacky method of always making some of them run and never idle.
	+Visual distortion and lighting oddities when particles are seen over liquids.
