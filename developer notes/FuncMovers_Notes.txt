DEV NOTES FOR HQ2

/******************************************************************************
MOVERS WITHOUT SCRIPTING
******************************************************************************/

Using func_mover_path: Your friend to making movers with out script.
We have added a new entity in HQ2 which will help save the mapper a little more time.  Many 2d games feature moving platforms.
Moving platforms have always been possible in Doom3, but they required scripting for best results.  You can now create movers
without any scripting required, all that has to be done is target one entity to the next.  The old ones still excist, but there
is no need for them now with a simpler system.

Check the playground map for an example of how to set up the new movers.

The new entities include:
func_mover_path:  This is the actual mover entity.  There are various keys with descriptions the mapper can set up.
target_mover_path:  These are the waypoints for the mover.  Have the func_mover_path target the first one.  
Then have the target_mover_path target the next target_mover_path.  If you target the first target_mover_path to the last one,
the movement will loop.  Ad as many target_mover_paths as you like to create complex movers.
