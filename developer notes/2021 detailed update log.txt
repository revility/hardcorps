		The cool thing is that it do all by itself. No need of scripting it. 
		It can also be started/stopped by triggering it and more... 
		(see the updated play ground map, where I also used few "target_mover_path" to create a path.

	
	
	
***Dynamic x position changing notes***
Player can dynamically change the X position: it's like there are different parallel horizontal planes on which 
player and monsters can play.  When player touches the new trigger "trigger_interact_change_x_pos" and presses 
the right aim up/down button, he is forced to walk to the new plane defined by the X position of the taget of 
the trigger.  Well it's more complex than this, but try the testmap and you'll see. 

When player is teleported its X position is automatically updated.
func_teleporter_fx --> plays the fx (default one is defined in the def) each time player is teleported there. 
func_teleporter_change_x_pos --> teleports the player, then it behaves like a  
"trigger_interact_change_x_pos" (only difference: movement cannot be aborted).
