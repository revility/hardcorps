DEV NOTES FOR HQ2

/******************************************************************************
DXP:  Using the Dynamic X position
******************************************************************************/

Using the Dynamic X position  (DXP changing system:

HardQore 2 might be a sidescroller, but that does not mean it doesn't take advantage of its 3d environments.  
Mappers can use this to move the player in and out of both the foreground and back ground.  It also allows the mapper to create
side rooms for the player to explore.  This adds in a new layer of depth to the game.

An example of using DXP can be found in the hq2/playground map.  
The best way to understand and use it is to look at and play this map.

How to up DXP in your maps:
Using the system is very easy to do.  You create triggers where you want to player to move to and from.
the new entity is called: trigger_interact_change_x_pos  Triggers are created at both ends where you want the player to go to & from.
To set up the changing, simply target one trigger_interact_change_x_pos to another trigger_interact_change_x_pos.

Entity Keys have been added to cancel out and letting monsters use the DXP also.

Teleporters can also be used with this new system.  This is great for creating doors in the background you wish the player to enter.
func_teleporter_fx --> plays the fx (default one is defined in the def) each time player is teleported there. 
func_teleporter_change_x_pos --> teleports the player, then it behaves like a  "trigger_interact_change_x_pos" 
(only difference: movement cannot be aborted).

Additionally a new glowing decal texture has been added.  These can be used to let the player now they can turn in a map.
They are located in textures/hq2/turnspot*
However, these are not needed because the hud also tells the same info in the bottom right corner
