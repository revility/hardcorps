DEV NOTES FOR HQ2

/******************************************************************************
2d Clip Texture Notes
******************************************************************************/

A new type of clip texture has been added to the game.  the 2d clip brush blocks the player, monsters, does aas and projectiles.
This was done to help save the mapper a little bit more time.

In HQ2, by default, all monsters & the player are lock to 0 x.  
This prevents them from moving sideways, or physics from knocking them around.  
You can turn this on and off for monsters by setting the key isXlocked to 1 or 0.
Turning it off is useful if you want enemies in the background doing stuff; like zombies eating dead bodies or imps crawling up walls.

additionally, we have also removed the ability for all enemies to sidestep.  This garuntees the enemy will always be in front of you.

Just because the monsers and player are locked to the 0 x position, does not mean you do not need to create monster or player
clips in your maps.  Player clips are needed in areas where the DXP system is in use.  Monsters need it to help their path finding
or they will start do odd behaviors.

Adding the textures/common/2d_clip into your maps is great for areas where the enemies and the player are around the same size.
Now you only have to create 1 clip brush instead of 2.
