DEV NOTES FOR HQ2

/******************************************************************************
TRIGGER NOTES
******************************************************************************/

HOW TO TRIGGER SECRETS IN YOUR MAPS:

HQ2 supports finding secrets in maps.  Triggering secrets is very easy to do.
Create a trigger once, and then target it to the new entity called "info_secret_found".
When the player touches the trigger, the Secret found! dialogue will apear in the hud.  HQ2 automatically keeps tracks
of the amount of secrets in maps for the end level stats screen.


HOW TO TRIGGER END LEVEL STATS
Once again, adding end levels stats into your maps is done via triggering new entities.
Create a trigger_multiple in your map.  Have the trigger "call" the following script: "showStatsOnHud"


HOW TO TRIGGER TIP BOXES.
Create a trigger once or multiple in your map.  Have it target the target_tip entity.  Add in the key "text_tip"
Fill in the text with what tip or info you want to display to the player.

HOW TO TRIGGER RADIO CHATTER
When playing D3, through out the game a small radio would apear in the bottom left hand corner and an audio file would be player.
To add this into your levels; create a trigger_once.  Have it target the entity called "func_radiochatter"
add in the following key to the func_radiochatter: snd_radiochatter.  Choose a sound shader to fill it in with and your ready to go.

PROPER WAY TO TRIGGER DOORS
Doors will automatically open themselves when the player is close to them if they are unlocked.  
However, this slows down the gameplay and is a little bit annoying.  Always place a trigger_once or multiple in front of doors.
Have the trigger target the door.  When the player touches the trigger, the door will automatically open.


HOW TO LOCK DOORS:
Locking and unlocking doors is done via the entity called target_lock.  It has only one key, locked.  Set this to 1 to lock a door.
Set it to 0 to unlock a door.  In order for it to work one or more doors is make the target_lock entity target each door.  You can
trigger the target_lock using variety of triggers, or even when a monster dies.  This is useful for mini boss battles, boss battels
or if you don't want the player to go somewheres quite yet.  If you want to use a monster's death to trigger target_lock;
Create a target on the given monster and point it to the target_lock.  Then have the target_lock target the door you want to open.
