DEV NOTES FOR HQ2

/******************************************************************************
ITEMS, WEAPONS & PROPS NOTES
******************************************************************************/

Adding items, weapons, etc to your maps:
	-Always remember to use item_*name* instead of movable items.  
	-The items version spin, float and glow.  This is universal for all Levels!
	-Even the enemies drop item versions now instead of movables
	-Weapons now all have an item version called item_*weaponname*
	
Enabling & disabling double jump:
	-The double jump ability is on by default.  This can be turned on & off via the mapper.
		The player does not get this ability until level 6.  
		We have added a double jump item to be used with scripting to turn it on.
		The item is called item_armor_boots
		To disable high jumping in your maps, place this in the void main of your level:
			$player1.doubleJumpEnabled( 0 );
		To re-enable it, trigger a script with this line of code:
			$player1.doubleJumpEnabled( 1 );
		This value is carried across all levels during a game.
		
New props for HQ2:
	-Some lwo versions of the m5models found in Doom3 were made to help out with mapping.  
		You can find these in the models/hqprops folder
		
Changes to weapon pick ups:
	-All weapon entities in HQ2 are named item_weaponname.  
		These versions spin, glow and bob in the air.  This makes it easier for the player to see.  Enemies also drop these versions.
		Mappers should never use the moveable versions of any items, ammo or weapons in the game.  Everything should be consistant.
